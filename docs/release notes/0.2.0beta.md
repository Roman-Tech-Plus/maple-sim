# Maple-Sim Beta 1: A New Start

It's been a month since we accounced maple-sim alpha, a lot has happened this month.  We've got **a lot of** help from the community developers.  Compared to maple-sim a month ago, we are more stable, easier to use and had some features.

## Lots of new features for Beta!

#### 1. Simplified Swerve Simulation
> üôè Contributed by [@GearFox](https://github.com/GearBoxFox)

The new `SimplifiedSwerveSimulation` class manages and controls a `SwerveDriveSimulation`. Similar to how your user code operates the physical chassis, it runs closed loops on the virtual drive and steer motors in the simulated drivetrain, mimicking the behavior of a real swerve drive. This provides an easier way to simulate swerve drivetrains without the need for the hardware abstraction code structure.

Check out the [documentation](https://shenzhen-robotics-alliance.github.io/maple-sim/3.1_SWERVE_SIM_EZ_MODE.html) for more details.

#### 2. Motor Controller Closed Loops Simulation
> üôè Contributed by [@oh-yes-0-fps](https://github.com/oh-yes-0-fps)

The updated `MapleMotorSim` now includes a feature to simulate high-frequency closed loops running on motor controllers. This allows teams using different vendor APIs to more accurately simulate the behavior of their motor controllers during simulations.

#### 3. WPILib Units Library
> üôè Contributed by [@buwunny](https://github.com/buwunny)

The [New WPILib Units Library for 2025](https://docs.wpilib.org/pt/latest/docs/software/basic-programming/java-units.html) has been fully implemented across the project. This improves API readability and eliminates potential issues related to unit conversions.


#### 4. YAGSL, Officially Supported!
> üôè Thanks to @nstrike for making this possible!

With help from the developers of YAGSL, we have successfully integrated maple-sim with the amazing [Yet Another Generic Swerve Drive Library (2025-beta)](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/pull/251).   A preview version featuring realistic swerve simulation will be available soon. 

Please [follow YAGSL on Github](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481) to stay updated when it's released.

## More Stable Hosting
We are now using GitHub Pages to host the library and its documentation, providing a more reliable and stable experience than before.

You can download the vendordeps from this url:
```
https://shenzhen-robotics-alliance.github.io/maple-sim/vendordep/maple-sim.json
```
No additional configuration is needed in Gradle‚Äîsimply drop the file into the `vendordeps/` directory, and the library will download automatically!

The online documentation is available [here](https://shenzhen-robotics-alliance.github.io/maple-sim/1_INSTALLING_MAPLE_SIM.html).

You can also access the online Javadocs [here](https://shenzhen-robotics-alliance.github.io/maple-sim/javadocs/).

## Full Changelog & Thanks
All the above couldn't have been possible without the help of the fellow community contributors. Deep and sincere thanks to:

## What's Next?

As the title suggests, this is just the beginning for maple-sim. Our team, alongside contributors from the community, is actively working on exciting new features. We're planning to release **Beta 2** next month, which will include the following updates:

#### 1. SimRobot Container
A new `SimRobot` class that encapsulates simulation classes modeling your robot, providing a more readable and intuitive API.
(Contributed by [@oh-yes-0-fps](https://github.com/oh-yes-0-fps))

#### 2. New Gamepieces API
A new API for simulating gamepieces, enabling teams to model how their robot processes intaken gamepieces.
(Contributed by [@oh-yes-0-fps](https://github.com/oh-yes-0-fps))

#### 3. CTRE Simulation Support
Integration with [CTRE's high-fidelity motor simulation](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/api-reference/simulation/simulation-intro.html), allowing **maple-sim** to deliver enhanced physics simulation for teams using the [CTRE swerve API](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/api-reference/mechanisms/swerve/swerve-overview.html).
(Contributed by [@Roman-Tech-Plus](https://github.com/Roman-Tech-Plus) and inspired by [Team 5104 *"The Breakerbots"*'s Custom Library - BreakerLib](https://github.com/BreakerBots/BRICK/blob/main/2025-beta/src/main/java/frc/robot/BreakerLib/swerve/BreakerSimSwerveDrivetrain.java))
